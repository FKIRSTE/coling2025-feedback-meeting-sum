    "definition": "Repetition in text refers to the unnecessary recurrence of information that has already been presented. This redundancy can manifest as verbatim repetition of phrases or sentences, or more subtle forms such as paraphrasing previously stated ideas without introducing new insights. While some repetition is used for emphasis or clarity, excessive redundancy leads to a decrease in textual quality by diluting the content's impact and wasting the reader's time. Effective communication should strike a balance, reinforcing key points without compromising the conciseness and engagement of the narrative.",

            "score": "1",
            "explanation": "This example shows low severity repetition. It reiterates the importance of renewable energy for sustainable development, using slightly different phrasing. The repetition here serves to emphasize the critical role of renewables but does not significantly detract from the text's overall quality or readability. It slightly reinforces the message without overburdening the reader with unnecessary redundancy."

            "score": "5",
            "explanation": "This text exhibits high severity repetition. It redundantly emphasizes 'machine learning in finance' and 'stock trading algorithms' without introducing new information or perspectives in each mention. The excessive recurrence of these terms and concepts bloats the text and significantly reduces its informative value, making it tedious and unengaging for the reader."
